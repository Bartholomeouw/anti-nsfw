# How to be a Translator, Anti-NSFW version.

**Before you translate, join the [Anti-NSFW Lounge](https://discord.gg/dkP9fwY) first, to make the developer keep in eyes on you if there was any update.**

## Rules:
- Keep the overall feeling of the bot consistent with the english version.
- Don't "paste old translations" into your translation file. All new translations will be added at the top of the category, which means - you can just paste from en_US the missing ones until the one you have. (and at the bottom of the command in the case of new command strings)
- Keep the translation clean.
- Don't remove or "translate" anything remotely like {user}, {var} or anything.
- Don't change the formatting marks (\*\*, \*, etc). If a word is \*\*like this\*\* translate it \*\*como esto\*\*, for example.
- We're gonna review translation files before going to production, so no worries if something happens to go wrong we will point it out and assist you.
- If you're unsure what a parameter is, you can try using the command or contact ray#1337.
- You can contact ray#1337 on Discord if you're lost.

## If you are creating a language:

- Create a text document anywhere on your computer and rename it to "\<your lang code\>.json" (i.e. for german de_DE.json). Yes that means the .txt becomes .json

  - When editing please use an actual code Editor to edit and not notepad. We suggest [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- Go to en_US.json in the above directory and copy everything you see in the box

- Paste it into the newly created file

- Replace all english sentences with the corresponding translation. Follow the guide below while translating.

- Once think the language is ready DM (Direct message) ray#1337 on Discord and tell him what language you translated to and upload the file along side it

## If you are adding to an existing langauge:

- Create a text document anywhere on your computer and rename it to "\<the code of the language\>.json" (i.e. for german de_DE.json). Yes that means the .txt becomes .json

- Go to \<the code of the language\>.json in the above directory and copy everything you see in the box

- Paste it into the newly created file

- Replace all still english sentences with the corresponding translation (Or correct exiting translations if applicable). Follow the guide below while translating.

- Once think the language is ready DM (Direct message) ray#1337 on Discord and tell him what language you translated to and upload the file along side it

## Any questions, by the way?
If you can't DM ray#1337, add him as a friend. Please ping me in [Anti-NSFW Lounge](https://discord.gg/dkP9fwY) before adding so I know who you are.
