- Browse the Local Folder of it and go to `\assets\languages`

- When creating a new translation, copy the en_US.json and rename the copy to your language (i.e Indonesia (Indonesian) would be id_ID.json) otherwise edit the file you want to contribute to.
 
  - When editing please use an actual code Editor to edit and not notepad. We suggest [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  
- Replace all english sentences with the corresponding translation. Follow the guide below while translating.
  1. Keep the overall feeling of the bot consistent with the english version.
  2. Don't "paste old translations" into your translation file. All new translations will be added at the top of the category, which means you can just paste from en_US the missing ones until the one you have. (and at the bottom of the command in the case of new command strings)
  3. Keep the translation clean.
  4. Don't remove or "translate" anything remotely like {var}, {user}, or {var1}
  5. Don't change the formatting marks (\*\*, \*, etc). If a word is \*\*like this*\\* translate it \*\*como esto\*\*, for example.
  6. We're gonna review translation files before going to production, so no worries if something happens to go wrong we will point it out and assist you.
  7. If you're unsure what a parameter is, you can try using the command or contact ray#1337.
  8. You can contact Kodehawa#3457 on Discord if you're lost.

- After you are done, send the changed file to Kodehawa#3457 on Discord for review.
- Once reviewed and being given the ok, go back to your Github desktop client.
